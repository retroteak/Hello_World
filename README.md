# Hello_World
This is a minor test...

...that I'm making according to the hello world tutorial to see how things work here.

Programming has been my hobby for few years and I know C++ and Python and little bit Rust. I'm mostly interested in artificial intelligence, music and video game related programming topics, but I'm never really shared my stuff - or made any finished products that are presentable to other people for that matter. However, I may be sharing few new projects of mine here in Github later, so see ya later ^^
